Constructors of a class are method fxns named the same thing the class is

"every class has an auto generated default constructor (assuming every member in the class has a default constructor or is a primitive)
once you create a constructor with arguments, the default is deleted
you can either then define the default constructor yourself" - Nick Muia (7-13-23)
